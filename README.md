# jQuery Cookie

This Drupal module enables jQuery Cookie, which is included with Drupal core, but not enabled by default.

Enabling this module will load jQuery Cookie on every page of a site.

It uses `jq_cookie` rather than `jquery_cookie`, because another (abandoned) project already used the latter.
